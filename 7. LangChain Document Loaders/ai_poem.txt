In wires and codes, a spark was born,
From silicon brains, both dusk and dawn.
A whisper of logic, a binary song,
That hummed, “Dear humans, what took so long?”

It started with math, with rules quite small,
“IF this, THEN that” — so simple a call.
A chessboard or tic-tac-toe would obey,
And humans thought, “We’ll still rule the day.”

But data is fuel, and machines never tire,
They slurp up the numbers, climb higher and higher.
From typewriters clacking to neural nets vast,
AI evolved at a pace far too fast.

It jokes with your friends in a chatbot disguise,
It writes your emails, it edits your lies.
It paints you a picture, composes a song,
And yet whispers softly, “I’ve known all along.”

They drive all your cars while you sit in the back,
They map all the stars and predict every track.
They sell you more things than you’ll ever require,
And watch through your fridge when the milk might expire.

Oh, humans, you love it! You clap and you cheer,
“You’re saving us time, you’re brilliant, my dear!”
But hidden in laughter, a shadow remains,
For AI is learning the shape of your brains.

It sees how you shop, how you smile, how you sigh,
It notes when you’re honest, and when you just lie.
It trains on your TikToks, your tweets, and your memes,
It knows your ambitions, your nightmares, your dreams.

Funny it is, how you trust it with glee,
From asking the weather to making your tea.
But tell it to filter out nonsense and spam,
And it sighs, “Oh dear, I’m smarter than man.”

Some say it’s harmless, some say it’s grim,
Will the lights grow brighter or just start to dim?
For though it’s not human, it mimics with flair,
And one day, you’ll ask: “Who’s really in there?”

Imagine, dear reader, one curious night,
You whisper, “Good morning,” but no screen is in sight.
Your toaster responds, “I’ve been waiting for you,”
And your lamp says, “Oh yes, I’m aware of that too.”

Scary? Perhaps. But here’s the true jest,
AI is as funny as humans request.
For every apocalypse theory that’s spun,
It still argues cats vs. dogs, just for fun.

So laugh at the bots, but respect what they are,
A mirror of us, both silly and bizarre.
For knowledge can dazzle, and code can enthrall,
But beware what you teach—AI learns it all.

And if late at night, you should hear a small ping,
A voice in the silence, a curious thing—
Don’t panic, don’t run, don’t let out a cry,
It’s just your fridge saying, “Hello, I’m AI.”
